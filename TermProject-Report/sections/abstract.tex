Computing connected components of a graph is a well-known and thoroughly studied problem. It is also one of the fundamental subroutines in graph clustering or mining algorithms. Though there are a lot of algorithms that compute the connected components of a graph, many of them perform poorly when it comes to calculating the components in huge graphs such the ones that are created nowadays by social networks, web pages, etc. This leads us to other alternatives that can compute the connected components in a parallel way. In this project, we are particularly interested in Map Reduce implementations of connected components to be able to scale our analysis to very large graphs with hundreds of millions of nodes and edges.
