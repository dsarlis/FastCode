The problem of finding connected components of a graph has been long studied in various distributed environments including the classical Parallel RAM (PRAM) model, the Block Synchronous Parallel Map Reduce. Since this project was mainly focused on Map Reduce implementations of the connected components algorithm, we are going to further elaborate only on Map Reduce implementations.
