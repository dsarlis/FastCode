The problem of finding connected components of a graph has been long studied in various distributed environments including the classical Parallel RAM (PRAM) model, the Block Synchronous Parallel Map Reduce. Since this project was mainly focused on Map Reduce implementations of the connected components algorithm, we are going to further elaborate only on Map Reduce implementations.

The work in \cite{rastogi} introduces an $O(logn)$ rounds Map Reduce algorithm, where n is the number of total nodes in the graph. This paper also describes an algorithm called Hash-to-Min which has proven to be even faster in practice. This algorithm is also the first that we implemented in this project. The major downside of this algorithm, however, is that it increases the intermediate data size in each Map Reduce round by up to a factor of 2.
